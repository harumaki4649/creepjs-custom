You may **not** use the Marks in the following ways. These actions are strictly prohibited:

1. **Domain Names:** You may not register or use any domain name containing "CreepJS" (e.g., `creepjs.org`, `creepjs.net`, `creepjs-v2.com`).

3. **Endorsement/Succession:** You may not imply that your fork is a "2.0", "Official", "Next Gen", or "successor" version of the original work.

## 6. Required Renaming

If you publish a modified version of this software as a distinct project, website, or product intended for public use, you **must change the name**.

* *Allowed:* A fork hosted at `github.com/user/creepjs` for development.
